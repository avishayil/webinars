## Meetup Desciription

"Reaching the Cloud" webinar series takes you through our journey at CyberArk to become could native and serverless.

There are great solutions to deploy cloud infrastructure resources for your application, but it's easy to get lost and find yourself ending up with insecure configurations. On this webinar we will see how can we set up AWS services and open source tools, alongside open-minded approach to security, in order to assess a vulnerable cloud infrastructure and make sure it is secure according to industry-based standards, and security best practices.

In this hands-on session we will:
 - Help you to increase awareness to cloud misconfigurations.
 - Provide you with practical tools identifying cloud misconfigurations
across the SDLC.
 - See where cloud configurations fall short at infrastructure-as-code
defaults.
 - Mitigate common attack patterns considering compliance & immutable
infrastructures.
